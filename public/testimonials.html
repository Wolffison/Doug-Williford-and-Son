                        <p>"The power was off, the generator was automatically running but power transfer to the house had not occurred. Technician Mr. Snuffy Weaver arrived promptly in an extreme rainstorm with heavy thunder and wind. He quickly determined the problem and stood in the driving downpour storm to produce a manual power transfer workaround until he could return (which he did the next day) and fully restore the automatic functionality. I have never seen anyone work under such adverse conditions. Snuffyâ€˜s boss is a lucky man, as are customers like us. Thanks again Mr. Snuffy." - Patrick Gamble, Hemphill, TX</p>
